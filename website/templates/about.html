    <p class="about-para">
      Data splitting: The first step is to split the data into training and testing sets using the train test split
      function with a test size of 20% and a random state of 42. This ensures that the same split is used every time the
      code is run.</p>

      <p class="about-para">Model training: The code trains a Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators and the same random state as the
      data split. This model is used to predict employee attrition on the testing set.</p>

      <p class="about-para">Model evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated using accuracy_score and classification report. Additionally,
      a confusion matrix is plotted using seaborn's heatmap function. This step helps to understand how well the model
      is performing in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy.</p>

      <p class="about-para">Feature importance: The feature_importances_ attribute of the Random Forest Classifier is used to plot feature
      importance. A bar chart is created using seaborn to visualize which features are most important in predicting
      employee attrition.</p>

      <p class="about-para">ROC curve and Precision-Recall curve: The final step is to plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve
      and the Precision Recall curve using scikit-learn's roc curve, auc, precision recall curve, and
      average precision score functions. These curves help to understand the trade off between sensitivity and
